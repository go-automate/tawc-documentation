= Rules

We tried to keep things simple and keep the rules minimal. They are:

|====
| Rule | Justification

| CSS Selectors must be used for all locators.
| This is the perferred locator for most tools and by using it across the board we wanted to avoid the `CSS Selectors` vs `XPath` row. However if a framework did state an alternative selector as it's preferred locator (e.g. Cypress has JQuery baked-in) we considered it fair to use that instead.

| No additional libraries
| To keep things fair, we only used libraries that were essential to the framework. These usually consisted of:

. The Framework library
. A `Test` framework
. An `Assertion` framework

If additional unrelated libraries or frameworks existed that could be used to `seed` the database etc. these were ignored, otherwise we would have to use them everywhere. HOWEVER: Third-party libraries that had been created to make frameworks more reliable and which were considered valid standard practice were used.
