Reliability Test Data `reliability-test-data.json` = there are 100 products in the object array.
Reliability Test Data `speed-test-data.json` = there are 8 products in the object array. Usually there are no failures in this small dataset so the speed of the tests can be reliably compared. Any runs with failures were ignored (Also useful for debugging and testing the tests as it's a small data set).
