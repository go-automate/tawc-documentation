*Name:* Loren Ipsum word

*Price:* Random choice of numbers (as a string) between 100, 200, 300 (for initial product) and 400, 500 and 600 (for editing a product)

We've also included a `debug-data.json` file with a couple of products in it. Use this when testing your code for your automation tests (so you don't have to wait for 100 products to be tested each time).
